## 📖 Introduction

InkSight aims to solve the pain point of separation between "reading" and "thinking" in traditional reading tools. It seamlessly integrates a multi-format document reader (PDF/EPUB/Markdown) with an infinite canvas mind map, supporting **drag-and-drop node creation** and **bi-directional linking**. Whether you are conducting academic research by reading papers or building a knowledge system by reading technical books, InkSight helps you transform information into knowledge more efficiently.
